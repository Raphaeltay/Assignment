# Project Outline
Football is an internationally recognised sport that crosses all ethnic and religious boundaries over the world. This report explores how Rarita, a country that wishes to qualify for the FSA League within 5 years in the “world of international football”. It explores the project’s objectives of creating a competitive national football team through data exploration and manipulation, to best optimise the probability of qualification through Monte Carlo simulation measures. Moreover, it details how the successful completion of the national football brand will affect Rarita’s economy over the next 10 years through a boost in global visibility and recognition of being a competitive team. However, assumptions about the model are prevalent and are also explored in this report. Moreover, the report also drafts an implementation timeline to rollout objectives of building and sustaining a competitive team and using this success to grow Rarita’s global visibility and economy.

### Team Selection
With both the initial sum and projected revenues being ample to cover player wages, the 19 selected players will slot into the team from the first year of implementation (2022).  The team will be analysed yearly, using end of year FSA League standings as the metric – ensuring the team stays on course to reach its competitive targets. 
Until the top 10 target is achieved (predicted 2024), contracts will be one-year terms, allowing for flexibility in team changes, and maximising team potential. Once this target is achieved, contracts will be extended to 3 years, to sustain team stability and build towards winning the tournament. 
### Financial Performance
In terms of revenue, there are 3 main sources – matchday, broadcast and commercial – as well as a supplement from loan fees. The Raritan Football Association will have to establish a loan structure, where players between the median and upper quartile will be loaned out, likely to unestablished teams also looking to enter the FSA. It is expected that those below the median will not have the quality to attract loans.  

The essential measure of financial performance is to determine if, by the end of 2024, the can hit its revenue metric targets of 65.7 doubloons/capita, 146.4 doubloons/capita and 202.48 doubloons/capital respectively for matchday, broadcast and commercial revenue. These numbers, if achieved, will reflect Rarita earning a similar level of revenue to the current top teams, once it is established amongst them.  
### Economy
Further, the increased broadcast revenue reflects the increased global visibility of Rarita, as this broadcast revenue is increasing as more people around the world tune in to watch the Raritan team play. Additionally, the impact of increased visibility can be seen in increased matchday revenue, with it expected to increase as more tourists come to watch games and pay premium ticket prices. The garnered tourists will require accommodation and services, and are likely to visit other Raritan attractions, thereby boosting the inflow of money across several economic sectors.
Global visibility will be further monitored using the metric of social media followers, with Facebook followers expected to hit the top team current average of 65 million, and Instagram followers to reach 49.6 million by 2024, in line with all forecasts of Rarita truly establishing itself as a top team by then. Every two years, follower numbers will be reviewed, to determine whether they match expectations of growing in line with attendance growth. 

# Risk Considerations
## Interest Rate and Inflation Fluctuations 
By assuming the Raritan government conducts monetary policy to bound inflation within comfortable levels, it is doubtless there may be circumstances where this is unsuccessful. Interest rates and inflation are inversely proportional to each other and as such there will be trade-offs of loan players with our funds. Our funds may not have the same purchasing power as in the past and moreover, interest rates may drive up the fee payments on these loans. 
Mitigant: Hedge against inflation through investing our funds in asset classes that track an index with a rate higher than the inflation level. 

## Competition Fines 
In the international spotlight, Rarita will likely encounter fines for breach of guidelines and regulations within the international sporting organisation. Fines issued may cause a backlog of future objectives and bottleneck the successful plan of being competitive within 10 years. 
Mitigant: To mitigate the impact of fines, Rarita may consider using buffers in their budget to offset potential fines. They can hold reserves with a certain proportion to account for such event. 

## Retention Rate of Players
To develop Rarita’s team dynamics and competitiveness over their tenure in the league, it is preferred that player retention is long term and a relatively stable figure each year. In its early formation, retaining players that are well synergised is beneficial to reducing time spent on team building, as well as strengthening these players’ dynamics within the team over time. Since it is unlikely that the team will win within the first few years, focusing on developing strong players will provide a competitive edge for Rarita in the long term. 
Mitigant: Provide monetary incentives from the budget to well-synergised players to be retained for the following league year.  

## Reputational Risk
Rarita’s reputation within the sporting community can be influenced by whether it is successful or not in the league. Reputational risk can be determined by whether Rarita’s reputation exceeds its true character, how much external beliefs and expectations change, and quality of internal coordination (Eccles, Newquist and Schatz, 2007). Moreover, reputational damage to the organisation may cause decreased funding and weaken traction of potential tourism and economic benefit in the future. 
Mitigant: Conduct regular surveys with fans to measure engagement and satisfaction with the organisation. Close gaps of misconceptions through creating a public relations team to coordinate media and moderate stakeholders’ perceptions of the business. Align internal decisions and objectives made by different business units, as one assumption of another business unit can cause reputational damage when that goal is not met. 

# Assumptions and Data Limitations
| Data Limitation | Assumptions | Justification |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Only provided data on tournament rankings for 2 years (2020 and 2021), but economic data is from 2016-2020 | Assumed that the top 10 teams across the 2 years were also the top 5 teams across the 2016-2020 period. | Allows analysis of the economic impact of being a top 10 team. Without assumption, there is no link between tournament rankings and economic data. | 
| No information given on which countries the leagues (other than RFL) pertain to. | Only league in Rarita is RFL. | Other leagues have no given connection to Rarita. Further, the assumption allows analysis of team revenues and expenses in Rarita. | 
| No information given on the quality of different leagues. | All leagues are of equal quality, so statistics across different leagues hold equal value. | Allows fair comparison between players in different leagues. |
| No information given on the population of other countries | Football is similarly popular across Rarita and the top 5 countries, Raritan attendances will reach similar levels once Rarita achieves a similar level of success. | Allows analysis of the impact of international football success on Rarita’s attendance, and thus future revenues/expenses.
| No explanation given for negative values for statistics such as: 	Goals & Shots, Penalties,	Key Passes & Assists,	1/3 passes,	Tackles, Pressures & Blocks,Saves| Goals & Shots: negative due to subtracting own goals and shots on own goal, Penalties: negative due to subtracting penalties conceded by a player, Key Passes & Assists: negative due to subtracting passes that directly lead to an opposition goal, 1/3 passes: negative due to subtracting | Without an explanation of these strangely negative statistics, the figures cannot be analysed, which would severely limit the pool of players that we could test our model on. |
| Complete data only on 2021 Tournament statistics | 2021 Tournament statistics (and related league statistics) are accurate reflections of players’ abilities. | Without any indications of past performance, there is no way to determine if these statistics reflect normal playing ability, or a momentary form improvement. The assumption allows us to analyse players’ stats equally. |
